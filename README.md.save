# Multilayer Perceptron Implementation With Spark And Python

## Dataset

The dataset is the [Consumer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database). It includes complaints of customers for some financial products and services. The file (.csv) is comma-delimited.

```
### customer_complaints.csv format:
"""
0 <- date %Y-%m-%d
1 <- category
2 <- comment
"""
```

## Main Goal

The goal of this project is to use Spark/MapReduce to implement a [Perceptron Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) by using the [TFIDF metric]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf
