# Multilayer Perceptron Implementation Using Spark And Python

## Dataset

The dataset is the [Customer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database). It includes complains from customers on some financial products and services from 2011 untill today. The data file is a comma-delimited .csv file. 

### File Format


```
0 <- date %Y-%m-%d
1 <- category
2 <- comment
```

## Main Goal

The goal of this project is to use [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) to implement a [Perceptron Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) using the [TFIDF metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).
